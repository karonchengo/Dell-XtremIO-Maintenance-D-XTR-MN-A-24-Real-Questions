<p>1. Why is an extra rack unit space used between X-Bricks when installing a multi X-Brick XtremIO X2?<br />
A. Manage the air flow between Storage Controllers<br />
B. Accommodate the cable management duct<br />
C. Provide space for an additional XMS<br />
D. Accommodate the routing for InfiniBand cables<br />
Answer: B<br />
Explanation:<br />
An extra rack unit space is used between X-Bricks when installing a multi X-Brick XtremIO X2 to accommodate the cable management duct. This space is essential for organizing and managing the cables, ensuring proper airflow, and making maintenance tasks easier.</p>

<p>2. What is a feature of the XtremlO storage array?<br />
A. Inline compression<br />
B. Post process deduplication<br />
C. Synchronous replication<br />
D. Disk sparing<br />
Answer: A<br />
Explanation:<br />
A key feature of the XtremIO storage array is inline compression. This feature allows data to be compressed in real-time as it is written to the storage system, which helps to reduce storage footprint and improve storage efficiency without impacting performance.</p>

<p>3. What is indicated when the XtremIO X2 NVRAM status LED is flashing red at one second intervals?<br />
A.Restore is in progress<br />
B.Backup is in progress<br />
C.Firmware or driver is loaded<br />
D.Uncorrectable error<br />
Answer: D<br />
Explanation:<br />
When the NVRAM status LED on an XtremIO X2 is flashing red at one-second intervals, it indicates an uncorrectable error. This is a critical status that typically signifies a hardware malfunction or failure within the NVRAM module, which requires immediate attention.NVRAM, or Non-Volatile Random Access Memory, is crucial for retaining data integrity during power losses or system crashes1.</p>

<p>4. Which document contains the detailed steps for re-imaging the Storage Controller when preparing for a single-to-dual X-Brick expansion?<br />
A.XtremlO Site Preparation Guide<br />
B.XtremlO Installation Summary Form<br />
C.XtremIO Hardware Installation and Upgrade Guide<br />
D.XtremlO Software Installation and Upgrade Guide<br />
Answer: C<br />
Explanation:<br />
The detailed steps for re-imaging the Storage Controller when preparing for a single-to-dual X-Brick expansion are contained in theXtremIO Hardware Installation and Upgrade Guide.This document provides comprehensive instructions on the physical installation, initial configuration, and upgrade procedures for XtremIO hardware components, including the process of re-imaging the Storage Controller1.</p>

<p>5. If an XtremlO X2 array experiences a power failure, which components will protect the journal data?<br />
A.BBU and NVRAM<br />
B.NVRAM and local drive<br />
C.Supercapacitor and NVRAM<br />
D.BBU and Supercapacitor<br />
Answer: C<br />
Explanation:<br />
In the event of a power failure, the XtremIO X2 array is designed to protect the journal data using a combination ofSupercapacitorandNVRAM. The NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory) ensures that the data remains intact without power, while the supercapacitor provides the necessary energy to maintain the power to the NVRAM during the outage.This design allows the XtremIO X2 array to preserve the integrity of the journal data until normal power can be restored1.</p>

<p>6. What is the cluster tolerance for the failure of one DAE Controller SAS port in an XtremIO X1 cluster?<br />
A.Loss of service<br />
B.Degraded service<br />
C.Data loss<br />
D.No impact<br />
Answer: D<br />
Explanation:<br />
In an XtremIO X1 cluster, the system is designed to tolerate the failure of one DAE Controller SAS port without any impact on the service or data integrity. This is because the architecture of the XtremIO X1 includes redundancy and failover mechanisms that ensure continuous operation even when individual components fail.The failure of a single SAS port would trigger these mechanisms, allowing the system to maintain normal operations and prevent data loss, service degradation, or loss of service1.</p>

<p>7. Which command is used to verify the ESRS configuration?<br />
A.show-syslog-notifier<br />
B.show-snmp-notifier<br />
C.show-email-notifier<br />
D.show-syr-notifier<br />
Answer: A<br />
Explanation:<br />
ESRS (EMC Secure Remote Services) configuration verification is typically done using commands that check for system notifications and configurations.<br />
The show-syslog-notifier command is used to verify the settings and configuration of syslog notifications, which is part of the ESRS setup.<br />
This command helps in ensuring that the notifications are correctly configured and functioning as intended, allowing for remote monitoring and management.</p>

<p>8. Which ports need to be open between the XMS and X1-SC1 to successfully operate Technician Advisor on an XtremIO X2?<br />
A.TCP ports 22 and 443<br />
B.UDP ports 80 and 442<br />
C.TCP ports 80 and 443<br />
D.UDP ports 22 and 442<br />
Answer: C<br />
Explanation:<br />
To successfully operate Technician Advisor on an XtremIO X2, TCP ports 80 and 443 need to be open between the XMS (XtremIO Management Server) and X1-SC1 (Storage Controller). These ports are used for HTTP and HTTPS communication, respectively, allowing for secure management and operation of the storage system.</p>

<p>9. What is an acceptable SSD configuration for an XtremIO X1 cluster?<br />

B.Must be mixed; space will be calculated using the smallest drive in the DAE<br />
C.Can be mixed in the same cluster; however, not mixed in the same DAE<br />
D.Can be mixed anywhere except within the first X-Brick of the cluster<br />
Answer: A<br />
Explanation:<br />
In an XtremIO X1 cluster, it is required that all SSDs (Solid State Drives) be configured with identical drive sizes. This uniformity ensures optimal performance and balanced wear leveling across the drives, which is crucial for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of the storage system.</p>

<p>10. Where can the Technician Advisor be found?<br />
A.support.emc.com<br />
B.XtremIO GUI<br />
C.SolVe Desktop<br />
